This folder contains the datasets extracted from the US Environmental Protection Agency:  Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Reporting Services

The website contains drinking water data from community water systems, including the population each system serves, and the number of violations from the most recent data.

Each state has to be queried individually, and the csv files are the data from each state query, where we added the state abbreviation to the end of the file name.
